# Lung cancer Dataset
A simple model for making a regression model from the given dataset from Kraggle 
the dataset consits of following data: 
1. Age The age of the patient.
2. Gender The gender of the patient. (Categorical)
3. Air Pollution The level of air pollution exposure of the patient. (Categorical)
4. Alcohol use The level of alcohol use of the patient. (Categorical)
5. Dust Allergy The level of dust allergy of the patient. (Categorical)
6. OccuPational Hazards The level of occupational hazards of the patient. (Categorical)
7. Genetic Risk The level of genetic risk of the patient. (Categorical)
8. chronic Lung Disease The level of chronic lung disease of the patient. (Categorical)
9. Balanced Diet The level of balanced diet of the patient. (Categorical)
10. Obesity The level of obesity of the patient. (Categorical)
11. Smoking The level of smoking of the patient. (Categorical)
12. Passive Smoker The level of passive smoker of the patient. (Categorical)
13. Chest Pain The level of chest pain of the patient. (Categorical)
14. Coughing of Blood The level of coughing of blood of the patient. (Categorical)
15. Fatigue The level of fatigue of the patient. (Categorical)
16. Weight Loss The level of weight loss of the patient. (Categorical)
17. Shortness of Breath The level of shortness of breath of the patient. (Categorical)

19. Swallowing Difficulty The level of swallowing difficulty of the patient. (Categorical)
20. Clubbing of Finger Nails The level of clubbing of finger nails of the patient. (Categorical)

# Test results: 
the confusion matrix after the regression model is: 
[[75  0  0]
 [ 0 67  0]
 [ 0  0 58]]

The accuracy score is: 
1.0
it means this model has accuracy 100% and able to predict all testset data
